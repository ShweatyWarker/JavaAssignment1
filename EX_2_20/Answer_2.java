// This program prints a right-angled triangle pattern using asterisks.
// Each System.out.println() prints a line of asterisks and moves the cursor to a new line.
// This creates a symmetric-ish pattern, starting small, peaking at 5 asterisks, then shrinking.
// You can think of it visually as a "mountain peak" pattern.

//Top part I got from Lucy, I'm keep it in because I need to read it to understand and remember how it works.
